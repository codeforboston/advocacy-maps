        <b>
          Why do we need Early/ Mail Voting?
        </b>
        <br />
        Representative democracy is stronger when more constituents participate in
        elections, and turnout is highest when participation is made easy.
        Massachusetts participation rates in the most recent elections indicate it was
        a success â€“ which stems largely from the emergency acts smartly passed by the
        Legislature in response to COVID-19 (see
        <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2020/Chapter115"> St.2020 c.115 </a>
        and <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2020/Chapter255"> St.2020 c.255</a>).
        Among the temporary changes made to our election systems was a relaxing of
        vote-by-mail (absentee ballot) restrictions, allowing individuals from across
        the state to vote early and by absentee ballot.
        <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/11/20/mail-in-ballots-made-up-42-of-massachusetts-votes-cast-in-november-election/"> 42% of registered voters in the
        Commonwealth took advantage of the relatively easy means to vote </a> and would likely
        do so again if given the opportunity. Massachusetts should retain these improved
        voting mechanisms.
