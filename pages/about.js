        <b>What is the Good Governance Project [GGP]?</b> 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We are a non-partisan, student-driven initiative at Boston College Law School 
        and the BC Clough Center for Constitutional Democracy. We advocate for faith in democracy, 
        and for democratic structures worth of faith; inclusive, equitable and responsive. 
        Using our Democracy Maps, we aggregate voices from across the state to advance 
        discussion on key governance issues. We also provide legal support to pro-democracy 
        organizations and legislators, and host events to galvanize and encourage faith in democracy.

        <b>The GGP Priorities</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        After studying our political institutions in the fall and winter, the GGP students identified 
        three state legislative priorities to improve the quality of democracy in Massachusetts: 
        <a href="/election-day-registration"> election day registration;</a><a href="/early-mail-voting"> early voting & vote-by-mail; </a>
        and <a href="/campaign-finance"> publicly financed campaigns</a>. 
        While there are many other legislative improvements to make to our democracy, which we identify <a href="/other-legislative-endorsements">here</a>, 
        these three priorities reflect the impactful, pragmatic, and common ground changes the GGP hopes to advance.
